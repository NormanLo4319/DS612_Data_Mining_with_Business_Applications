# DS612_Data_Mining_with_Business_Applications
An introduction to statistical learning with application in R.  This course will help students develop Statistical Learning techniques to extract pertinent information from data and make informed business decisions.

## Textbook
We are using "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani in this course.  You can check the textbook details [online](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/).

## Course Outline
### Introduction to R
In this lab, we will introduce some simple R commands.  The best way to learn a new language is to try it out.  R can be downloaded from [here](http://cran.r-project.org/)

Learning Objectives:
1. Learning how to find and set your working directory on your machine.
2. Learning how to use simple function to create vector and matrix
